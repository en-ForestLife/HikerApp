  "GlovesInfo" : "Most of the mountains in Korea are stone mountains\nThere are more cases of holding ropes and iron than you think.\n\nRather than holding it with your bare hands,\nIf you hold it with gloves, it doesn't slip\nMy hands don't get cold, so I recommend you to take them with you!\n\nEspecially in the winter, if you put your hands out,\nIt's like my hands are falling off\nyou can feel it, so make sure to take it with you!",

  "WetTissueInfo" : "When you eat snacks or lunch boxes, it's hard to eat with dirty hands\nWet wipes that can be useful for wiping off dirt when it's hard to sterilize right away!\n\nIt is better to take care of it because it is uncomfortable without it than you think.",
  "PoleInfo" : "I heard this a lot from people who like San\n\"Make sure to take a pole so that your knees don't go out when you're young.\"\n\nEven if you're a good mountain climber, your knees can't help but strain\nIf you want to enjoy the mountain for a long time, protect your knees by dispersing the load!\n\nSo the best way is to use a pole to distribute the load between the lower body and the arms.\n\nThis is because no matter how muscular and strong a person is, it is a different problem that the knee is loaded."
